\begin{itemize}
\item Andrew was absent due to illness.  He has been communicating via internet. 

\item Group members had a lot of trouble over the weekend that inhibited progress. 

Problems included: 
\begin{itemize}
\item Installing github
\item pulling and pushing the git repository 
\item pushing tex files
\item finding the codebook/data directory
\end{itemize}


\item Heather had based her question on the 2014 survey; however, she found that surveys prior to 2012 did not contain questions about household access to computers and/or internet.  This made it \emph{impossible} for her to answer her original question of interest. 
\item Heather is changing her question to looking at the type of energy that homes are using and the amount spent on electricity in households.  These will be compared across states. We are specifically interested in looking at trends of "clean" energy. 
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Proposed Assignment}
\begin{itemize}
\item Assignment from Meeting \#3 is being extended to Wednesday April 16th. 
\end{itemize}
